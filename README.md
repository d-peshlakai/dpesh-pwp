PWP milestone one


## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job with Milestone 1! Your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case are all clear and descriptive. Your HTML is written well, excepting two minor things.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- The `<li>` tags within your `<ol>` tag are not indented properly
- You have an extraneous `<p>` tag at the end of your body

## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Milestone 2&alpha; is looking good, I like your wireframes especially. You may consider rolling your `About Me` and `Contact` pages into one page unless you have a lot of content planned for `About Me`. I also noticed that your HTML is missing a few elements, detailed below.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; Passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric), but if you make the changes detailed below before the due date, I can bump it up to Tier III.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- You need to add `<head>` and `<body>` tags, and move your metadata and content into those tags, respectively.
- Make sure your HTML is indented properly, your `<li>`s should be indented inside that `<ol>`, and all of those elements after the `<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>` should not be indented. If you hit `Ctrl + Shift + F`, then PhpStorm should automatically format your code.

## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job with Milestone 1! Your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case are all clear and descriptive. Your HTML is written well, excepting two minor things.

Your Milestone 1 Passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric). Information regarding milestone 2 can be found in the [Milestone 2 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions

- The `<li>` tags within your `<ol>` tag are not indented properly
- You have an extraneous `<p>` tag at the end of your body
